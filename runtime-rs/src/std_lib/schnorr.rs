//! Schnorr-on-Jubjub signature verification, off circuit.
//!
//! There are **two** Schnorr circuits in the Compact ecosystem, and they are
//! not interchangeable. They derive the challenge from the same hash and then
//! reduce it differently:
//!
//! | circuit | challenge reduction | off-circuit verifier |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | standard library `jubjubSchnorrVerify` | `cFull mod r_jubjub` | [`verify`] |
//! | vendored `schnorr.compact` module | `cFull mod 2^248` | [`verify_truncated_challenge`] |
//!
//! Since `2^248 < r_jubjub`, the two disagree whenever the hash is at least
//! `2^248` — which is essentially always. A verifier substituted for the wrong
//! circuit therefore rejects valid signatures, and computes a predicate that
//! is not the one the on-chain proof enforces. Each verifier here is named for
//! the circuit it corresponds to, and the tests pin the difference in both
//! directions.
//!
//! Two further asymmetries are deliberate:
//!
//! - **The signature type is local rather than a re-export.** Ours declares
//!   `response: Fr` because Compact declares that field `Field`; upstream's
//!   declares `response: EmbeddedFr`. Generated code constructs these values
//!   by field name and type, so the layout has to match the Compact struct.
//!   `fr_to_embedded_fr` is the reduction between them, applied at the call
//!   boundary.
//!
//! - **[`jubjub_schnorr_verify`] does not reject the identity**, because the
//!   standard library circuit it mirrors does not. Adding the guard would make
//!   the Rust path refuse signatures that circuit accepts — a new divergence
//!   rather than a fix. [`verify`] and [`verify_truncated_challenge`] do
//!   reject it, because their circuits do.
//!
//! [`schnorr_verify_jubjub`] is the circuit-shaped wrapper generated code
//! calls: it takes a `CircuitContext`, threads it through a no-op
//! `query_for_verify`, and surfaces rejection as
//! `CompactError::AssertionFailed`.
