;; ==== Other hashing circuits
(declare-native-entry circuit keccak256 [A]
  "__compactRuntime.keccak256"
  ([value A (discloses "a hash of")])
  (Bytes 32))
;; No `(rust ...)` clause: there is no upstream Rust binding for keccak256 —
;; midnight crypto exposes keccak only as a ZK circuit chip. Leaving the field
;; #f makes `native-call-site-rust` reject a call at COMPILE time. It used to
;; carry `unimplemented!()`, so a contract calling keccak256 compiled cleanly
;; and panicked at run time instead.
