// Witness execution context + a trivial `NoWitnesses` marker for contracts
// that declare zero witnesses.

//! Witness execution context for `compactc --target rust`-generated contracts.
//!
//! # Witness privacy model
//!
//! Every generated `Witnesses<PS>::<method>` returns `(PS, T)`. `PS`
//! (private state) is a free generic parameter on `WitnessContext`,
//! `CircuitContext`, `ConstructorContext`, `CircuitResults`, and
//! `ConstructorResult`, with **no** `Aligned` / `FieldRepr` /
//! `BinaryHashRepr` / `From<…> for AlignedValue` bounds. The type
//! system therefore forbids pushing a `PS` value into a `StateValue`
//! or any other serialised on-chain representation — `PS` is
//! structurally confined to the four well-known fields that thread it
//! between constructor / circuit invocations, none of which feed the
//! `ChargedState` that becomes `ContractState.data`.
//!
//! The witness *value* `T` is a normal Rust type. Whether it is safe
//! to write to a public ledger field is the contract author's
//! responsibility — the codegen has no way to tell which `T` values
//! are private by intent. See the user-guide subsection
//! [Witness privacy model][1] and the structural audit at
//! `docs/superpowers/research/2026-06-02-witness-threading-audit.md`.
//! The operational guard is the regression test at
//! `tests-e2e-rust/tests/witness_leak_check.rs` (Prod-11).
