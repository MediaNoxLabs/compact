//! Places where this crate and the TypeScript runtime have to compute the
//! same thing, pinned by tests.
//!
//! TypeScript is normative: it is what the deployed contracts and the chain
//! already agree on. So every test here asserts a Rust result against a
//! TypeScript rule, and where the two once disagreed the test says which
//! way the disagreement went.
//!
//! What makes this class of bug hard to see is that both sides look
//! reasonable in isolation. Each function here was written against a real
//! upstream primitive with the right-sounding name; it was the wrong one.
//! Nothing but a side-by-side reading finds that, which is why it gets its
//! own file rather than being scattered through the unit tests.
