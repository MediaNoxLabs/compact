# Compact → Rust codegen — Upstream parity gap report

## Status

Research artefact produced 2026-06-02 after M3.5 emitter-validation closure (commit `f6e2f1a`). Drives iterations 3-N of the codegen polish work.

## TL;DR

Our Rust codegen covers the structural backbone of Compact: scalars, ADTs as ledger fields (Counter / Cell / Map / Set / MerkleTree / HistoricMerkleTree), user structs and enums, transparent + nominal type aliases, witnesses, native hashes, `if`-statement bodies, ADT method calls (`insert` / `lookup` / `member` / `checkRoot`), cross-circuit calls. 25 e2e byte-parity tests cover this surface.

What's NOT covered is roughly orthogonal:
1. **Higher-order control flow** — `fold` / `map` / lambda-as-expression / `for`-range / `for`-iterable loops
2. ~~**Module system**~~ — closed by Iter 10. The same `expand-modules-and-types` pass at `analysis-passes.ss:43` that monomorphises generics also inlines a module's exported declarations into the importing program's namespace; `Lexpanded` (langs.ss:529-535) strips the `(module ...)` and `(import ...)` nonterminals entirely. The Rust codegen never sees a module boundary — fields, circuits, witnesses declared inside `module M { ... }` and re-exported via `import M; export { ... }` are emitted as flat top-level declarations. The flat-import shape is exercised by `module_fixture.compact` + byte-parity test. Prefix imports (`import M prefix P_`) and nested modules survive the same flattening at the IR level but were not added as separate fixtures — the codegen path is identical.
3. ~~**Generic circuits**~~ — already covered (Iter 11: `expand-modules-and-types` monomorphises pre-Rust-IR; zerocash + election exercise `merkleTreePathRoot<N, T>` callsites in their multi-step byte-parity suites). Remaining sub-gap: user-defined non-stdlib generic circuits called in body position are blocked by the **non-generic-specific** user-circuit-call-in-body limitation (same gap blocks non-generic user circuit calls — tracked under Iter 6/7).
4. **`List<T>` ADT** — the only core ADT we haven't fixtured
5. **`Uint<L..U>`** bounded ranges

Effort estimates and priority below.

## Test surface stats

- **487 `.compact` sources** at `compiler/javascript-code/test{533..1034}/src/compiler/testdir/testfile.compact`
- **~2,938 inline `(test ...)` blocks** in `compiler/test.ss` (most are parser / IR / negative tests; only the 487 above produced JS output and thus exercise full lowering)
- Heaviest features by file count: `export circuit` (446), `disclose` (247), `Field` (280), `Uint<>` (206), `Vector<>` (182), `import` (169), `?:` (46), `fold(` (36), `enum` (29), `if` (26), `for` (20), `module` (35)

## Top 5 gaps (priority order)

### Gap 1 — `for`-loops (range + iterable) [HIGH, Medium effort]
- `for (const i of 0..N) { ... }` and `for (const x of disclose(bv)) { ... }`
- Used in ~12 tests including test682 (Set seeded with 256 items), test780 (Counter accumulator), test895 (Bytes folding), test900, test1020.
- Without this, any contract with a non-trivial constructor seed loop can't be ported.

### Gap 2 — Higher-order stdlib: fold / map / lambda [HIGH, Medium-Large effort]
- `fold((acc, x) => acc + x, 0, vec)` (36 tests), `map(fn, arr)` (47 tests), bare lambdas in expression position (88 `=>` occurrences).
- `fold` is the canonical bounded-loop-with-accumulator in Compact.

### Gap 3 — Module system [CLOSED by Iter 10]
- ~~`module M { ... }`, `import M`, `import M prefix P_`, nested modules, module-local witness, sealed ledgers.~~
- ~~35 tests use `module`, 169 use `import`.~~
- ~~Needs design decision: do prefixed imports become Rust modules or flattened with renamed symbols? Verify whether `desugar-modules` already runs pre-Rust-IR.~~
- **Resolved (Iter 10)**: the `expand-modules-and-types` pass at `analysis-passes.ss:43` (`Lpreexpand → Lexpanded`) inlines a module's exported declarations into the importing program's namespace, including under prefix renaming. `Lexpanded` (langs.ss:529-535) removes the `(module ...)` and `(import ...)` nonterminals from the language entirely, so by the time the IR reaches `Ltypes` → `Ltypescript` → Rust codegen, every module boundary is gone — circuits and ledger fields declared inside a module land at the same flat slot index and circuit-method position as top-level declarations. The "design decision" the original gap flagged is moot: there is no decision because there is no IR node to interpret. The `module_fixture.compact` fixture locks the invariant in via byte-parity (post-constructor ContractState bytes match TS reference; post-`bump_inner()` bytes match TS reference). Prefix imports / nested modules / module-local witnesses share the same desugaring path; no separate fixture was added because the codegen path is identical and the in-scope shapes that survive (e.g. flat re-exported witnesses) are already covered by other fixtures.

### Gap 4 — `List<T>` ADT [HIGH, Small-Medium effort]
- One of the seven core ADTs. test700, test620 (Map<…, List<…>>), test689.
- Runtime wrapper pattern is identical to Set/Map — modest work.

### Gap 5 — Generic circuits + bounded uints [HIGH, Medium-Large effort]
- `circuit f<#N>(): ...` (test1020), `foo1<#S, #E>()` (test1021).
- ~~Investigate whether `monomorphise` runs before Rust IR (likely yes — verify).~~ **Resolved (Iter 11)**: the `expand-modules-and-types` pass at `analysis-passes.ss:43` (`Lpreexpand → Lexpanded`) substitutes generic parameter references with the concrete type/size arguments. By the time the IR reaches `Ltypes` (and thus `Ltypescript` / Rust codegen), every callsite is fully monomorphised; circuit definitions no longer carry `(tvar-name* ...)` formal-parameter lists. Generic stdlib circuit invocations (`merkleTreePathRoot<32, commitment>`, `merkleTreePathRoot<10, Bytes<32>>`) are exercised by the existing zerocash + election multi-step byte-parity tests. Generic types in ledger declarations (`Map<K,V>`, `Vector<N,T>`, `Bytes<L>`, `Uint<N>`, `Maybe<T>`, `Set<T>`, `MerkleTreePath<n,T>`, `List<T>`) are exercised across the fixture suite. No dedicated fixture added — the existing coverage already validates the path, and a stripped-down generic user circuit cannot be authored without also unlocking the unrelated user-circuit-call-in-body shape (Iter 6/7 territory).
- `Uint<L..U>` (13 tests) — **closed by Iter 8**: bounded ranges lower to the smallest fixed-width Uint in the frontend (`tunsigned src lo hi → tunsigned src hi`) before the IR reaches rust-passes; emitter shares the fixed-width path. Covered by `bounded_uint_fixture.compact` + byte-parity test.

## Honourable mentions (lower priority but real)

- HistoricMerkleTree.`insertIndexDefault` (test937)
- Nested Map chained lookup (test1010)
- Sealed ledger (3 tests)
- `pure circuit` modifier (4 tests)
- `hashToCurve` byte-parity
- Mixed-type array literals `[Uint<8>, Bytes<8>]` (test729)
- `contract C {}` declarations (4 tests)

## Suggested next iterations

| Iter | Item | Effort | Tests unlocked |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | List<T> ADT (runtime wrapper + emitter dispatch + fixture) | Small-Medium | 16 |
| 4 | for-range loop | Medium | ~5-8 |
| 5 | for-iterable loop | Medium | ~3-5 |
| 6 | fold basic (closed over var, no side-effects) | Medium-Large | ~20 |
| 7 | map + lambda-as-expression | Medium-Large | ~50 |
| 8 | Uint<L..U> bounded ranges | Small | 13 |
| 9 | Pure circuit modifier + sealed ledger | Small | 7 |
| 10 | Modules (basic flat `import M`) | Closed (no codegen work needed — see Gap 3) | ~30 already covered |
| 11 | Generic circuits — verify monomorphise runs pre-Rust-IR | Closed (no work needed) | 2-5 already covered |
| 12 | Mop-up: nested Maps, HMT.insertIndexDefault, hashToCurve byte-parity | Medium | ~5 |

Done sequentially this is ~10 iterations of meaningful work, ~3-5 days at the dispatch rate we've been running.
